# petra

Embed a reverse HTTP proxy into an existing ES6 application.

Features:

- Filesystem-backed cache
- Prevention of the thundering herd problem via a dogpile lock
- Respects upstream Cache-Control headers

Does not yet support:

- [ ] Upstream authentication
- [ ] Caching of full response headers
- [ ] Use of If-Modified-Since

_This is alpha-quality software and is not yet ready for use in production environments._

## Usage example

```javascript
import Petra from 'petra';
const petra = new Petra();
petra.fetch('http://api.upstream.com/resource', (err, filename, created, expires) => {
  // filename is the path to the local file containing the response
  // created is the Date when the response was originally cached
  // expires is the Date when the response will become stale
});
```

## API

### new Petra(options)

Where `options` is an Object containing:

#### cacheDirectory

The directory in which to store cached items, defaulting to `/tmp/petra`.

#### hash

A function to generate cache keys, defaults to SHA-256.

#### minimumTtl

The minimum TTL for cached items in seconds, defaults to 7 days.

The TTL for each response will be the minimum of this value or the max age of the upstream HTTP `Cache-Control` response header.

#### purgeStaleInterval

The interval in seconds between purges of stale content in the cache, defaults to 1 hour.

#### mediaTypes

An array of accepted `Content-Type` upstream response headers, defaulting to the empty list and therefore allowing any.

#### requestTimeout

The length of time to wait to connect to an upstream source, defaulting to 10000ms.

#### responseTimeout

The length of time to wait, after connecting, for an upstream source to provide data, defaulting to 10000ms.

#### retries

The number of attempts that will be made to connect to an upstream source, defaulting to none.

#### userAgent

The `User-Agent` header for upstream requests, defaulting to `lovell/petra`.

#### debug

Enable debug to help trace peer/upstream problems, defaults to `false`.

#### log

The function to call with debug messages, defaults to `console.log`.

### fetch(url, callback)

Fetches a remote `url`, first checking with the local filesystem cache.

The `callback` function is passed `(err, filename, created, expires)` where:

- `err` is the error, if any.
- `filename` is the path to the cached file containing the response.
- `created` is the Date when the response was originally cached.
- `expires` is the Date when the response will become stale.

### purge(url, callback)

Removes cached copy of the URL, if any, from the local filesystem only.
